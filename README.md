# roguelike-js
Roguelike game written in javascript using the rot.js library and the coding.cookies tutorial

This is my first javascript project, first time using Git, and first roguelike.  So there's a ton to learn and I would love to hear your suggestions, critques, warnings and any general feedback you'd care to share.

The tutorial I'm using for this can be found at http://www.codingcookies.com/2013/04/01/building-a-roguelike-in-javascript-part-1/

If you'd like to follow along with the other roguelike developers.  Check out the r/roguelikedev group on reddit.

(I'll come back and prettify this readme later.  First time to work with a markdown file.   lol)
